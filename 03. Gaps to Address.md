# Issues and Limitations

This file outlines the key issues and limitations identified in test.py

## 1. Incomplete Browser Tab Management
### 1.1 What's going wrong? 
- this code directly navigates to each article link using `driver.get()`, causing loss of the original page context.
- (once navigating away, and coming back, selenium won't be able to reference the element)
- No handling of multiple tabs or going back to the homepage.
- Risk of crashing if a webpage structure changes slightly.
### 1.2 Possible fix
- either open a tab, we get our task done, close it 
- manage the single tab clearly using driver.back()

## 2. Unable to open article links
### 2.1 What's going wrong?
- this code navigates to the Opinion tab successfully, but is unable to extract the link of the individual articles. (Generic Link)
### 2.2 Possible fix
- use precise selectors. 

## 3. Missing Image Handling
### 3.1 What's going wrong?
- Images are default logo. 
### 3.2 Possible fix
- Check whether the image is within the article's content block. 

### Minor Inconsistencies that can be addressed: 
- Extracted images (if any) are not saved in a dedicated folder.
