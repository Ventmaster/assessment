# Refinements

This file highlights the improvisations made to the script. 

## 1. Proper Tab Management
- Opens a new browser tab for each article (`driver.execute_script("window.open('');")`).
- Closes tabs after extraction to prevent memory leaks and maintain original context.

## 2. Articles link working properly. 

## 3. Image Download and Organization
- Extracts article images and saves them locally.
- Creates an `images/` directory automatically (`os.makedirs("images", exist_ok=True)`) for clean storage.

## 4. Robust Error Handling
- Wrapped sensitive operations (title extraction, link fetching, content parsing) inside try-except blocks.
- Prints informative error messages without breaking the program flow.

## 4. Organized Code Structure
- Each step (open homepage → navigate to section → extract articles → open article → extract/save data) is clearly separated.

## 5. Some other optimizations. 
- Slightly better CSS Selectors (`h2 a` instead of just `h2`) for more accurate scraping.
- Ensures image downloading via `requests.get()` only if an image URL is present.
